TEXTFINDER - alpha version

This app allows you to search a word or a text within a PDF file or within all the PDF files stored in a certain folder.
This kind of search may be useful to check whether a certain file or group of files contains the kind of informations you are looking for without reading it.
The output is a complete list of all the occurrences of the searched text within all the selected files,
with indication of all the pages where you can find the text and the number of occurrences for each page.

WARNINGS: 
- It only works with native PDF files, because of the limitations of PyPDF2 modules.
- It could take 2-3 minutes to give output.
- The user interface graphic is very basic.
- In case you browse a group of files the response widgets will adapt automatically to the window without resizing the window itself.
  So, if the number of files is very high this could make the output hard to read.
